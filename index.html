  <h1>From Me to You</h1>

  <p>
    Hi Rana :) I made this for you because I am a genius.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wanted to make a website where I could put my poetry about you. <br>
    Or leave some thoughts or what I did in a day, or something new that might pop up! <br>
    Time will tell. <br>
    Also, I like you eheheh <br>
    Also, Also, hopefully I can clean this up more after I get used to coding this thang.

    <b>Jan 5th 6:18 <br></b>
    As I write this <br>
    During a late-night drive <br>
    I find these moments precious <br>
    With you<br>
    In a limited space and time <br>
    I wish I could stop looking at the road<br>
    And look at you <br>
    All this flat land<br>
    Reminds me of the Netherlands <br>
    My wanders to a distant future<br>
    What if we see a future? <br>
    Together.<br>
    I realize I will never completely know you<br>
    A playlist called weeee<br>
    Driving at the age of 19<br>
    But that’s beautiful <br>
    And I never want that to stop <br>
    And hopefully one day I will truly know you<br>
  </p>

<b> Pillow Talk (Jan 27th 2026)</b> <br>
My room at Found is bleak<br>
I never decorated it because I thought<br>
“What’s the use if I am to leave?”<br>
Thus, ornaments and trinkets I never bought <br><br>

But I was always envious of room 943<br>
A space of comfort in a foreign city<br>
A sanctuary from all this noise<br>
Though I was grateful I did not have her roomie <br><br>

It smelled like spices<br>
It smelled like joy <br>
It smelled like laughter <br>
Now it smells like a good memory <br>
It felt like home <br>
Obviously, not because of my lover <br>
Ok<br>
Maybe it is<br><br>

Now her room has been invaded<br>
I will likely never step in there again<br>
I wonder if it smells the same<br>
Selfishly, I hope it does not <br><br>

Now I am in my room<br>
Wondering <br>
“What is she up to?”<br>
A little daydream to help me cope<br>
I almost bring myself upstairs <br>
Hoping she still resides there <br>
But I give myself the bliss of memory <br><br>

My room remains bleak<br>
But there is now a new color scheme <br>
Of matte pink<br>
A pink pillow on my bed<br><br>

It makes me like my room a little more<br>
I think about you when I lay my head<br>
Though my intentions aren’t always so pure <br>
