    Hi Rana :) I made this for you because I am a genius. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to make a website where I could put my poetry about you. <br>
    Or leave some thoughts or what I did in a day, or something new that might pop up!. <br>
    Time will tell. <br>
    Also, I like you eheheh 
    </p>

  Jan 5th 6:18 <br>
As I write this <br>
During a late-night drive <br>
I find these moments precious <br>
With you<br>
In a limited space and time <br>
I wish I could stop looking at the road<br>
And look at you <br>
All this flat land<br>
Reminds me of the Netherlands <br>
My wanders to a distant future<br>
What if we see a future? <br>
Together.<br>
I realize I will never completely know you<br>
A playlist called weeee<br>
Driving at the age of 19<br>
But that’s beautiful <br>
And I never want that to stop <br>
And hopefully one day I will truly know you<br>
</p>
